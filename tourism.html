                            <h3>Currency</h3>
							<p>The official currency in Argentina is the peso, whose symbol is $ and can be displayed with the ISO 4217 code as ARS. Banknotes in circulation are: $ 2, $ 5, $ 10, $ 20, $ 50 and $ 100. The coins are: 5, 10, 25, 50 cents; $ 1 and $ 2.</p>
							<p>You can check the official exchange rate against other foreign currencies on the website of Banco Nación: http://www.bna.com.ar/ or a currency exchange store. Due to limitations on the use of foreign currency in our country, there is a parallel market for foreign exchange which is illegal. That is why we want to warn you not to transact with people or companies working in this market, even if it may seem like a more attractive offer. Our recommendation is to make exchange money in banks or authorized entities which can be found around the San Martin Square in the center of the city of Cordoba.</p>
							<p>If you need to have pesos upon arrival (to pay for a taxi for example) exchange at the airport. Remember to check the final price as each exchange company charges a commission.</p>

                            <h3>Transport</h3>
                            <p>There are 3 ways of public transport in the city of Cordoba:</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Bus:</strong> Called locally as "colectivo", consist of corridors identified by color, each line on a corridor has a specific route and it is identified numerically.<br>
                                <strong>Taxi:</strong>Yellow and work the same way as in almost any city in the world, you can stop them on the street.<br>
                                <strong>Remis:</strong>It consists of green colored cars and their operation is similar to taxis, except that the only way is to get a ride is by phone call, that is because they are forbidden to pick up passengers in the street like taxis do. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Before going forward, bear in mind that in Córdoba either taxis nor remis accept credit cards as payment option you have to pay cash.</p>
                            <h4>Day rate</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Taxi:</strong> $14,70 first 110m, after that $0,73 every 100 meters<br>
                                <strong>Remis:</strong> $15,3 first 100m, after that $0,68 every 100 meters
                            </p>
                            <h4>Nightly rate (from 11:00pm to 6:00am</h4>
                            <p>
								<strong>Taxi:</strong> $16,15 first 110m, after that $0,80 every 100 meters<br>
                                <strong>Remis:</strong> $16,8 first 100m, after that $0,75 every 100 meters
                            </p>
                            <p>
							In our country it is not customary to tip the driver, so you should expect your change back and it is his responsibility to providing it. If the driver does not have any, they should round the fare for the benefit of the passenger.
							</p>
                            <h4>To and from the airport</h4>
							<p>
							There are two ways to get to and from Ingeniero Ambrosio Taravella International Airport: bus or taxi, the latter being the most recommended and safe. While the cost of a taxi to the airport can be up to 90% more expensive than a bus trip, we recommend that you taxi. The approximate cost of a trip from the center of Cordoba to the airport is ARS $120, and from the airport to the city center cost is approximately ARS $170. The difference resides in the cost of initial fare for trips beggining at the airport (ARS $58), for trips starting at the rest of the city expect to be charged by the day and night rates above.
							</p>
							
                            <p>If you need to know the approximate cost to and from the airport by reference to your hotel, you can get an estimated cost on the following website: <a href="http://www.miautobus.com">http://www.miautobus.com</a></p>
							
                            <p>
							We recommend you to check this site before landing in Cordoba, that way you know how much money you need to exchange to pay for the taxi (remember they do not accept credit cards). Thus, you avoid changing more money than needed and then can do it as you need in the center of the city, in a place that will surely get you better values ​​than at the airport.
							</p>
							
                            <p>
							It is always advisable to first check the status of flights, and be attentive to any cancellation or schedule change. You can check this information on the website of Aeropuertos Argentina 2000, responsible for administering Cordoba's airport. <br>
                            State of arrivals and departures: <a href="http://www.aa2000.com.ar/vuelos/arribos.aspx?qA=COR">AA 2000</a>
                            
							<h4>In the city</h4>
                            <p>
							As mentioned above, the transport in the city of Cordoba consists of taxis, remises and buses, the latter being the most popular choice when moving within the city. Here are the basic operation of the urban transport system of buses, from costs up to how to find our way on the web.
							</p>
							
                            <p>Remember you can use the website <a href="http://www.miautobus.com">MiAutobus.com</a> to check routes or rates to move within the city.</p>
                            
							<h4>Public / urban transport</h4>
                            <p>
							In Cordoba and in almost every major city in our country, urban transportation does not use cash when paying the ticket, instead a proximity card is used when hopping on the bus.
							</p>
							
                            <p>
							This card is commonly known as "Red Bus", as it takes its name from the supplier. You can get and charge your Red Bus card at the Central bus station (Terminal de Colectivos) stores B10 and C19, and at Airport Taravella (1st floor, "Open 25" store).
							</p>
							
                            <p>
						
							The Red Bus card costs ARS $25; to buy it you must charge it with the amount of money you want (without exceeding the technical limit of $ 300). You must pay cash, Red Bus card cannot be paid or charged by credit card. 
                            You can use it immediately without having to activate or enable it. The credit load builds up and does not expire.
							</p>
							
                            <p>When charging, the Municipality of Córdoba gives the benefit of an extra, so for example paying ARS $100, an ARS $110 will be available to use in travel. The cost of each trip per passages is ARS $7.15, but in reality and thanks to this 10% benefit, ends up being ARS $6.43.
							</p>
							
                            <p>
							If the balance on the card is not enough to pay a ticket, it is possible to "travel credit" up to 2 times with any rate; the amount used will be charged at the next charge.
							</p>
                            
							<p>
							Unlike other similar systems, the Red Bus card can be borrowed and used by other/s person/s, so if you do not want to keep it, you can pass it to another person. If you are coming come to the event in a group, you can buy a single card and use it for the whole group, thereby reducing costs.
							</p>
                            <p>Some city hostels sell and charge the Red Bus, you can find out before arriving if they provide this service.</p>

                            <h3>Cordoba's Culture</h3>
                            <p>A little about the culture of our city.</p>
                            <h4>Cuarteto</h4>
                            <p>
							While it may not be the favorite of all people of Cordoba, the "Cuarteto" (quartet) is the popular musical style you will hear in most taxi's, radio or discos during your stay. Carlos "La Mona" Jimenez is one of its greatest references, among others.
							</p>
							
                            <h4>Barbecue</h4>
                            <p>
							As is to be expected in our country, "Asado" (barbecue) occupies a central place in our society, and Choripan (chorizo sandwich) along with Lomito (steak sandwich) are the typical sandwiches. If you want to treat yourself to eat a good Argentine asado, please consult local guides like Yelp or Gastronomic Tour for tips and prices.
							</p>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <h4>What is choripán?</h4>
                            <p>
							It is a French style bread sandwich stuffed with roasted meat (pork and cow) sausage, accompanied by tomato, lettuce, mayonnaise and several sauces. 
                            The best place to try one is "Parque Sarmiento", a green space located next to the "Nueva Cordoba" neighborhood. To give you an idea how important choripán is, for the last 2 years the city has held the World Choripán Festival, under the auspices of the Municipality of Cordoba.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Lomito</h4>
                            <p>
							And if we talk about sandwiches, another classic is a steak one called Lomito. It's a sandwich of white bread stuffed with a piece of sliced beef tenderloin, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, fried egg, cheese, seasonings to taste and cooked ham. Always accompanied by french fries.
							</p>
                            <h4>Fernet</h4>
                            <p>All the prevous can't be alone at a table, so surely you'll have them accompanied by a "Fernet", the preferred drink of Cordoba. It is prepared with fernet + ice + Coca Cola. Experts say the perfect mix is 5% ice + 30% fernet + 65% Coca Cola; those who want to venture a little further, can modify the percentages to include more fernet in the mix. 
							<br>
							We recommend drinking with moderation and responsibly. And never drink if you are going to drive.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Alfajores</h4>
                            <p>
							The classic souvenir of our lands is the "alfajor serrano", a candy made of two round wafers stuffed with milk caramel or fruit jams. The most popular course is  the chocolate one filled with dulce de leche (milk caramel).

							<p><strong>Pueblo Nuevo:</strong> Unavoidable visit in the list of all travelers who want to know the first working class neighborhood of Cordoba.

From our “Cabildo” and neighboring Cathedral separated by the “Pasaje Santa Catalina”, witness of the last military dictatorship in our country. All this and a number of museums, vaults and basilicas compose this journey through the history of the city.</p>
							
                            <p><strong>Córdoba de las Campanas:</strong> A journey through the historic culture of the city, formed by temples, churches and basilicas. A universe that is part of the Cordoba identity.</p>

                            <p><strong>Nueva Córdoba: </strong>This is the busiest area in the city, a place where most young people who come to study in Cordoba choose to live. It has also witnessed the growth of the city in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, it is where you can find many museums and religious attractions.</p>

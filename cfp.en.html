							<p>User Experience Design, Interaction Design and Human-Computer Interaction are broad terms that have been used by vibrant professional and academic communities, oftentimes in separate events in Latin America.In 2015, we have decided to come together in Interaction South America and the Latin American Conference on Human-Computer Interaction. During Days 1 and 2, a scientific track will present contributions selected by the CLIHC 2015 Program Committee, whereas a practitioners track will present work carefully curated by the ISA Professional Committee. For the first time in South America, the synergy of both communities will be experienced.</p>

					<h2>Design is a serious business</h2>
					<h6>If our design community wants to grow the profession and have a seat at the table, then it needs to understand that design is not the center of the universe. Certainly, design is a cornerstone in the process of product development, but the end point is a successful product, a product that maximizes business value.
					<br><br>
					The dichotomy between business and design is just a sign of the long path to maturity we have ahead. It is, at the same time different sides of the same problem. On one hand, taking to our users a product that will delight them, at the right moment, and with the resources we have available; and on the other hand, supporting the business proposition we want to develop. 
					<br><br>
					It is very important for designers to grasp notions about how to manage projects, how to lay out a plan of action to attack a problem and, in that line of thought, how to select the relevant techniques and methodologies for each project. Projects have a budget, lack of planning or the selection of wrong practices impacts directly on the budget of the project, impacting on the cost-benefit ratio and of course ROI.
					<br><br>
					Design is not the endpoint. A design abstraction with no consideration for the user needs, technological viability or the projected business model is doomed to failure. It is time to assume that design is a key factor of the business equation. Design is a serious business.

						<h2>CLIHC Call for proposal</h2>
						<!-- <h4>El Comité Académico de CLIHC invita a:</h4> -->
						<h6>The Latin American Conference on Human Computer Interaction (CLIHC) aims to provide a premier forum that brings together the Latin American and international HCI research communities to discuss and exchange ideas, methods, approaches and techniques for designing interactive user experiences. This conference has its origin in Rio de Janeiro 2003 (Brazil), following editions in Cuernavaca 2005 (Mexico), Rio de Janeiro 2007 (Brazil), Merida 2009 (Mexico), Porto de Galinhas 2011 (Brazil), and Guanacaste 2013 (Costa Rica). In consonance with previous editions, we believe that in the field of HCI we must come to a technology that not only can be used and appreciated by as many people as possible, but that also promotes intercultural exchange and cooperation between people with different backgrounds and needs.
						<br>
						This year, CLIHC 2015 is organized jointly with Interaction South America (ISA 2015), the annual event that brings together the professional community in Interaction and User experience design. Participants will have the unique opportunity to explore synergies and collaboration opportunities between the research and practitioners communities.
